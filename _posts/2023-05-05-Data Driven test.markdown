This project is created for school project in course, Data Driven Society supervised by J.W.Yoon, Library and Information Science, JBNU.   

This project is focused on the social use and the visualization of data.   

I was the team leader of this project, and our team members including me are from the student government.
When I was a vice-president in my department, I've often heard complaints about the commute environment.  
Accordingly, Memories of that time led us to choose this topic !!
