During my summer vacation in 2023, I visited to UNLV(University of Nevada, Las Vegas) in Las Vegas to work on project under the guidance of a professor Kang.
Professor Kang is from an engineering school, computer science department, so I was able to learn from him in a more technical way. 
I initially proposed an interdisciplinary study in the social sciences like LIS, but my professor wanted me to focus on technology this summer, so I followed his direction.
And it was still a great experience to me.     


So Let me introduce my team's project in UNLV !! 

( note : This is a Final-presentation paper! )

We use this [data][data] from Kaggle, it was used to determine whether a user was at risk of defaulting on a bank loan. 
And it was literally "Big-data", becasue it contains 252,000 rows!! About Two hundred fifty thousand !!! 
So we had to use a method called "MapReduce" to process big data efficiently and quickly. 





{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
