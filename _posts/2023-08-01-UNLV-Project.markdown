During my summer vacation in 2023, I visited to UNLV(University of Nevada, Las Vegas) in Las Vegas to work on project under the guidance of a professor Kang.
Professor Kang is from an engineering school, computer science department, so I was able to learn from him in a more technical way. 
I initially proposed an interdisciplinary study in the social sciences like LIS, but my professor wanted me to focus on technology this summer, so I followed his direction.
And it was still a great experience to me.     


So Let me introduce my team's project in UNLV !! 

( note : This is a Final-presentation paper! )

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
