During my summer vacation in 2023, I visited to UNLV(University of Nevada, Las Vegas) in Las Vegas to work on project under the guidance of a professor Kang.
Professor Kang is from an engineering school, computer science department, so I was able to learn from him in a more technical way. 
I initially proposed an interdisciplinary study in the social sciences like LIS, but my professor wanted me to focus on technology this summer, so I followed his direction.
And it was still a great experience to me.
