Hello! Welcom to my Page!   
Thank you for your visit !  
     
I am Subin !  
     
    
I'm a very active, creative, and constantly improving person.  
This personality helps me move forward !  
  
I am very colorful person ! like a rainbowüåà !     
Let me introduce my colors ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíöüíúüíõ

#### 1. <span style="color:red"> Leadership </span> 
I am **a highly dirven** person - capable of anything what i want to do. I revitalize the team and plan for each step.
From now on, I leaded lots of teams composed of undergradute students as me.  
The personalities of members were all different, some are much passionate, the others are a little passive.  
Sometimes, I am in a dilemma that how could i take a balance with them..!  
I can regualate the passive member by using penalties or some disciplines, but obviously it's not the best way.   
  
So I tried to understand why they don't want to do active actions in team.   
The most common reason that i met is "the lack of confidence and experiences".  
They don't know their potential power and often they think that their participations will be a hindrance to others.
At this point, I should tell them their role in detail, and always review the team's goal and our current location while giving them courage. 
At a first glance, It seems to being a teacher, not a leader, but it's really needed to lead a passive member. 
    
I can't gurantee it's the best way, however it makes sense at lesat for my case.

#### 2. <span style="color:yellowgreen"> Sociability </span> 





&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
#### 3. <span style="color:blueviolet"> Creativity and Adaptability</span> 

Sometimes, or often, knowledge supports productivity.  
Since I have 3 majors, I have the interdisciplinary power to fuse various fields freely. 

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
#### 4. <span style="color:orange"> Resilience</span> 
Have you ever heard about Resilience ?  
Actually, It is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recover and grow again in spite of adversity and hardships.
Everyone has a hard time. **The important thing is how to get out of that period and overcome it.**  

Once, I have an experience that the project was canceled on the way to wrapping up, as the partner ghosted EVERYONE !!
I was very desperate because there was nothing I could do for him. It makes me impotent.
Soon I also lost my will, and fell into a sense of loss. That was the beginning  of **Burn-out**.   
  
When I found out that I had something psychological problems, I went on a trip straight away alone.  
And I thought a lot while traveling.
In that time, **I gave another meaning to the things that I had thought to have failed. (A.K.A. Redefining)**  
I did not think that It just not a waste of time, but I tried to think that it's a kind of learning and growth of time.

The reason why I suddenly went on a trip was that lots of my friends comforted me, but I thought I was the only person who could really console me.
So I need time to face myself honestly, that's why I set off on a trip.  
The result is..... It was working well, and I got back my Positive power.   

Plus, Now I'm telling you, this is how I decided to be a researcher.  
( Before that, I wanted to be a politician like real congressman. and...The ghosted partner was my running mate for election.) 
I felt lost at that time, but now I've found my aptitude, and I'm on a roll now.üëç    
  S
**It is what Redefining is !! - the key way to overcome trauma.**  
Every failure has learning and growth, and I trust myself. 
  
This is the secret of how am i becoming **an tumbling doll-like person who can overcome anything well.**

#<center> < Story about my triple majors !üò≤ > </center>
&nbsp;   
## Q1 : What is the feature of each major ? 
&nbsp; 
üëâ <span style="background-color:#fff5b1"> **library and Information science** </span> is my first major at university.   
Even though it is not an engineering program, I can learn information technologies. And It fascinated me ! 

üëâ <span style="background-color:#fff5b1"> **Statistics** </span> makes me study anything much easier.  
Basically, I learn research methodologies, furthermore, I learn many statistical techniques.  
That's why It is highly connected to other disciplines, like LIS and PSY.  
For example, information search used in LIS is the application of supervised learning and unsupervised learning. And no need to mention the connection between psychology and statistics.  
My favorite areas in statistics are data Visualization and text mining !!  
This is because, It can be useful in social media analysis or data curation.  



## Q2 : Why am I decided to fuse these 3 major? 



## Q3 : What is my plan to applying these three ? and what is my interests ??


## Q4 : What is my next step ?? 
I am preparing to enter the M.L.I.S(master of library and information science) program, now.  
It was hard to choose the direction what to study more. This is because I really like all of my majors, and these 3 majors are complementary each other to research what i want.  
**If it's possible, I wanna make use of all my majors and carry out an interdisciplinary study.**
This is the reason why i choose the MLIS program **which welcome the convergence and respect the diversity.**
