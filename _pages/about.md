#### 1. <span style="color:red"> Leadership </span> 
I am **a highly dirven** person - capable of anything what i want to do. I revitalize the team and plan for each step.
From now on, I leaded lots of teams composed of undergradute students as me.  
The personalities of members were all different, some are much passionate, the others are a little passive.  
Sometimes, I am in a dilemma that how could i take a balance with them..!  
I can regualate the passive member by using penalties or some disciplines, but obviously it's not the best way.   
  
So I tried to understand why they don't want to do active actions in team.   
The most common reason that i met is "the lack of confidence and experiences".  
They don't know their potential power and often they think that their participations will be a hindrance to others.
At this point, I should tell them their role in detail, and always review the team's goal and our current location while giving them courage. 
At a first glance, It seems to being a teacher, not a leader, but it's really needed to lead a passive member. 
    
I can't gurantee it's the best way, however it makes sense at lesat for my case.

#### 3. <span style="color:blueviolet"> Creativity and Adaptability</span> 

Sometimes, or often, knowledge supports productivity.  
Since I have 3 majors, I have the interdisciplinary power to fuse various fields freely.

#### 4. <span style="color:orange"> Resilience</span> 
Have you ever heard about Resilience ?  
Actually, It is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recover and grow again in spite of adversity and hardships.
Everyone has a hard time. **The important thing is how to get out of that period and overcome it.**  

Once, I have an experience that the project was canceled on the way to wrapping up, as the partner ghosted EVERYONE !!
I was very desperate because there was nothing I could do for him. It makes me impotent.
Soon I also lost my will, and fell into a sense of loss. That was the beginning  of **Burn-out**.   
  
When I found out that I had something psychological problems, I went on a trip straight away alone.  
And I thought a lot while traveling.
In that time, **I gave another meaning to the things that I had thought to have failed. (A.K.A. Redefining)**  
I did not think that It just not a waste of time, but I tried to think that it's a kind of learning and growth of time.

The reason why I suddenly went on a trip was that lots of my friends comforted me, but I thought I was the only person who could really console me.
So I need time to face myself honestly, that's why I set off on a trip.  
The result is..... It was working well, and I got back my Positive power.   

Plus, Now I'm telling you, this is how I decided to be a researcher.  
( Before that, I wanted to be a politician like real congressman. and...The ghosted partner was my running mate for election.) 
I felt lost at that time, but now I've found my aptitude, and I'm on a roll now.üëç    
  S
**It is what Redefining is !! - the key way to overcome trauma.**  
Every failure has learning and growth, and I trust myself. 
  
This is the secret of how am i becoming **an tumbling doll-like person who can overcome anything well.**
